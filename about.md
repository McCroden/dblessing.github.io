_System Administrator by trade. Developer and open-source enthusiast at heart._

<img style="float:right; margin-left: 30px;" class="circular" src="../images/drew.jpg" />

While my official job title is "System Administrator" I largely consider myself to be a developer.
At work our team practices devops, we plan sprints and write Ruby code with tests and continuous integration.

Open-source plays a huge part in our infrastructure and I love embedding myself in the communities
surrounding these projects. There is something much more rewarding about using open-source software
when you really become a part of the community.
