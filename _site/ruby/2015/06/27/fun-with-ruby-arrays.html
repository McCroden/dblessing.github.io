  <article class="post-content">
    <p>This week alone I have lost hours of my life to strange behavior with Ruby arrays and hashes.
Now that I know what’s going on it all makes sense but I can see how someone can easily be
confused by this. I’m sharing it in hopes that others might avoid the same pitfall
and as a reminder to myself in the future.</p>

<h2 id="arrays">Arrays</h2>

<p>The issue I ran into with arrays involves iteration. Specifically, while iterating over an array
I was also selectively deleting that item from the array if it matched some criteria. What I found
is that I was ‘randomly’ failing to iterate over some values in my array.</p>

<p>Here’s an example of what I was doing:</p>

<p>```ruby
current_rules = [
  { rule_number: 100, action: :deny, protocol: -1, cidr_block: ‘10.0.0.0/24’, egress: false, port_range: -1 },
]
desired_rules = [
  { rule_number: 100, action: :deny, protocol: -1, cidr_block: ‘10.0.0.0/24’ },
  { rule_number: 200, action: :allow, protocol: -1, cidr_block: ‘0.0.0.0/0’ },
  { rule_number: 300, action: :allow, protocol: 6, port_range: 22..23, cidr_block: ‘172.31.0.0/22’ }
]</p>

<p>desired_rules.each do |desired_rule|
  # The array elements (hashes) don’t match exactly. Rule number match is what we’re looking for,
  # but the rest of the hash keys will be different.
  matching_rule = current_rules.select { |r| r[:rule_number] == desired_rule[:rule_number]}.first
  if matching_rule
    # Anything unhandled will be removed
    current_rules.delete(matching_rule)
    # Anything unhandled will be added
    desired_rules.delete(desired_rule)</p>

<pre><code>if matching_rule.merge(desired_rule) != matching_rule
  # Replace anything with a matching rule number but different attributes
  replace_rules &lt;&lt; desired_rule
end   end end ```
</code></pre>

<p>Since <code>current_rules</code> and <code>desired_rules</code> both have <code>rule_number: 100</code> they are deleted from both arrays.
That seems fine, but what happened when that element got removed from the <code>desired_rules</code> array I am currently
iterating over?</p>

<p><code>desired_rules</code> now looks like this:
```ruby
[
  {:rule_number=&gt;200, :action=&gt;:allow, :protocol=&gt;-1, :cidr_block=&gt;”0.0.0.0/0”},</p>
<p>]
```</p>

<p>All the remaining elements in the array shifted forwarded by one index. Element with
<code>rule_number: 200</code> shifted from index <code>1</code> to index <code>0</code>. The next iteration over the array is index <code>1</code>, now
<code>rule_number: 300</code>. Whoops!</p>

<p>Knowing the issue here is most of the battle. The solution is rather easy - just clone the array before iterating:</p>

<p><code>ruby
desired_rules.clone.each do |desired_rule|
  ...
end
</code></p>

<p><code>desired_rules</code> elements still shift one index forward but we’re iterating over a clone that is unaffected by the
delete action.</p>

<p>Special thanks to Christopher Webber (@cwebber) for suggesting this post. It’s a great, small topic to get my blog
off the ground. I will remember to blog about small issues like this more in the future.</p>
